# calcumate_v3

GENERAL

Toolkit: Jetpack Compose

A tool that helps users identify the total amount of money they have, done via taking/selecting a photo of said money. 
Uses Google's ML Kit (text recognition, object detection) to identify currency within an image and totals the amount, displaying it back to the user.

Limitations:
- Currently only supports AU currency

WIP items:
- Coins: totalling amount of coins is yet to be implemented
- Allowing a user to select an existing photo to analyse

Improvements:
- Coroutines/multi thread processing
